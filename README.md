# Build a dynamic Avatar Component in React

Some fiddling around with Typescript and React based on Joe Previte's [TypeScript Course (or part of it)](https://www.typescriptcourse.com/tutorials/build-a-dynamic-avatar-component-with-react-typescript/).

Short look into some more Vitest as well as some minor TS usage and the generic.

## Stuff used

- pnpm
- Vite / Vitest
- JSDOM & JEST-DOM Matchers
- React
- TS
